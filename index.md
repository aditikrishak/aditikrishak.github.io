## About Me   
 
**PhD Student, Department of Physics and Astronomy, USC**  
Working with [Prof. Elena Pierpaoli](https://dornsife.usc.edu/elena-pierpaolis-web-page/)  

  
I study the cosmic microwave background (CMB), focusing on the search for signatures of primordial non-Gaussianities. My work explores how these signatures can provide insights into the physics of the early universe.
